We have been requested to create a web site that assists consumers
weigh various options in the insurance, loans and mortgage products.
offered by various companies. The website will have filters and
calculators where one can key in a loan amount  and period and gets
feed back on institutions offering products within his range. the user
can also scroll to a an amount range and period and is updated with
the relevant information.
The site has three interfaces:
1. The client interface where the consumer interacts with the sight to
compare prices and products. This is what can be viewed by the public.

2. The institutional interface where companies that have their
products on the website can update product features and add new items.
this will be accessible through a login.

3. The Admin interface which will be accessibly to the site owner
where he can add or delete companies, change passwords view analytic s
and generally have control of the entire website.

I have already done a mock up for the website will be sending it you
soon, the sites you should check out are comparethemarket.com for the
calculators and batakenya.com for the price slider. Think of a price
we can quote and timeline so we can start coding.
